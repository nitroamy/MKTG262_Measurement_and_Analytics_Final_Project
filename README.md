# MKTG262_Measurement_and_Analytics_Final_Project
Final Project for Marketing (Measurement and Analytics) Class

Objective:
1) Applying my knowledge of taking raw data, analyzing it and crafting it into a presentation
2) The metrics I pick to include in my presentation should help tell my story

For my final project, I used Seattle's pet license data (2018 dataset) to analyze the pet preference, popular breeds and name in Seattle 2018. Data source 

I used for the project: https://www.kaggle.com/city-of-seattle/seattle-pet-licenses; I made a little modification to the data format (i.e. date format) for the analysis
